# libft

A completed project at 42 Silicon Valley, that involved recoding standard functions from the next libraries:

<stdio.h>
<stdlib.h>
<string.h>
<strings.h>
<ctype.h>

It also involved making functions that work with linked lists.

As soon as all functions included in this repo were for all known edge cases, feel free to have them at your own disposal.

## Usage

(1) Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/stubisdon/libft.git`
(2) Compile the library with 'make'
(3) Include this library in your code with '#include "libft.h"'
(4) Make sure that libft.h is in the same folder with your new code.
